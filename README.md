This site is built using the Rust static-site generator [Zola](https://getzola.org).

To build the site:

1. [Install Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/). 
2. From the project directory, run `zola build`. The output will be in the `public` directory.
3. Alternatively, to view the site immediately in watch mode run `zola serve --open`.
